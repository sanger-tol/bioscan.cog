# BIOSCAN Quality Control

The BIOSCAN project is dedicated to the study of genetic diversity among one million flying insects across the UK over a span of five years. Insects are being systematically collected from 100 different sites on a monthly basis by project partners and subsequently analyzed at the Sanger Institute using DNA barcoding. The resulting sequence data will serve as a fundamental reference for understanding insect species diversity in both spatial and temporal dimensions, making it an invaluable resource for DNA-based biomonitoring in the UK.

## Repository Purpose

This repository has been created for the purpose of conducting quality checks on BIOSCAN sequencing runs prior to depositing the data on [BOLD](https://www.boldsystems.org) or the [BIOSCAN Partner portal](https://bioscan.tol.sanger.ac.uk/report-card).
